    "THE TEMPLE CHURCH" /></a> <h3>THE TEMPLE CHURCH.</h3></div>
<p>The Temple Church,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
  London, was erected in the twelfth century; but among antiquarians considerable
  difference of opinion at various times prevailed as to who were the original
  builders of these round churches, which form the most striking and beautiful
  specimens of the architectural skill of our Anglo-Norman ancestors. In England
  there are four examples of round churches, almost in perfect preservation, namely,
  the church of St. Mary, Temple; St. Sepulchre, Northampton; St. Mary, Cambridge;
  and that of Little Maplestead, Essex. It was long thought that they were of
  Jewish origin; but through the ingenious and learned essays of Mr. Essex and
  of Mr. Britton, this erroneous notion has been entirely removed. Mr. Essex,
  in his Essay, observes, in support of his opinion, that &quot;their Temple at
  Jerusalem was not of a circular form, neither was the Tabernacle of Moses; nor
  do we find the modern Jews affect that figure in building their synagogues.
  It has, however, been generally supposed that the round church at Cambridge,
  that at Northampton, and some others, were built for synagogues by the Jews
  while they were permitted to dwell in those places. But as no probable reason
  can be assigned for this supposition, and I think it is very certain that the
  Jews who were settled in Cambridge had their synagogue, and probably dwelled
  together in a part of the town now called the Jewry, so we may reasonably conclude
  the round churches we find in other parts of this kingdom were not built by
  the Jews for synagogues, whatever the places may be called in which they stand.&quot;&mdash;It
  has been generally allowed by these and other writers on archaeology, that the
  primitive church of this form was that of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and
  that the Temple Church at London was built by the Knights' Templars, whose occupation
  was the protection of Christian pilgrims against the Saracens. It has been further
  urged by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>
a correspondent (Charles Clarke, Esq. F.S.A.) in the first volume of
  Britton's &quot;Architectural Antiquities,&quot; that two of the before-mentioned
  round churches, namely, Northampton and Cambridge, were in fact built by &quot;affluent
  crusaders, in imitation of that of the Holy Sepulchre;&quot; and in support
  of his opinion he cites several historical notices.</p>
<p>The late perfect restoration of the Temple Church ought to be proudly recorded
  in our architectural annals. The excellence of the workmanship, and the native
  purity of the detail, evince not only scientific skill, but also a laudable
  motive of preserving this antique specimen of pure Anglo-Norman architecture
  from the ravages of time. Let the architect's attention be directed to the western
  doorway, and also to the interior of the church; and here, in good preservation,
  he will see excellent specimens of their mode of ornamenting the moldings by
  the cable, the lozenge, the cheveron, the nail-head, the billet, &amp;c. &amp;c., ornaments
  peculiar to the <i>round style</i>. The circular-headed windows, with their
  slender columns, also show, that in the restoration the style has not been tampered
  with; but substantial authorities have been quoted to perfect this praiseworthy
  attempt of the architect. That part of the church which has been added at a
  later date than the circular part, and for the convenience of divine worship,
  is lighted by the beautiful proportioned triple lancet-shaped windows, so justly
  admired. A writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for May, 1827, after making
  some judicious remarks, seems to think the crosses on the ends of the building,
  &quot;as not in character with the building.&quot; Now as to architectural propriety
  in the decorations of a Christian church, no ornament could be better devised;
  and if we proceed to the antiquity of such ornament, I would observe, that the
  adoption would be equally correct, that being the insignia of the banner under
  which the Knights' Templars originally fought.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p>She had moreover notions <i>high</i>, </p>

    <p class="i2">The <i>apple</i> of her eye.</p>

  <div class="stanza">

<h3>GREAT BELL OF GLASGOW.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

<p>In the steeple of Glasgow is a great bell, which is twelve feet one inch in
  circumference, and has a grave and deep tone. In 1789, it was accidentally cracked
  by some persons who got admission to the steeple. It was, therefore, sent to
  London, and cast anew. On the outside of it is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p align="center" class="center"> In the year of grace<br />

<h2>FINE ARTS</h2>
<hr />

<h3>THE PROGRESS OF PAINTING IN FRANCE.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

<p>Whether the French were first indebted to the Roman school for their knowledge
  of the art of painting is a matter of some doubt; indeed, several celebrated
  French writers affirm, that they first had recourse to the Florentine and Lombard
  schools; while others very strenuously declare, on the other hand, that the
  Venetian artists were alone resorted to, on account of the remarkable splendour
  of their colouring. A late author, however, observes, that the French do not
  appear to have imitated any school whatever, but to have adopted a style peculiar
  to themselves, which though perhaps not a noble one, is nevertheless pleasing.
  Though it is acknowledged that the French have a particular style, (i.e. a style
  of their own,) yet their progress in the arts has been exceedingly fluctuating
  and uncertain, so that it is actually impossible to ascertain who was the first
  reputable artist amongst them. Cousin was a painter on glass, and certainly
  obtained a good reputation amongst his countrymen. But he in fact possessed
  very little merit, and his name would not doubtless have been known to posterity
  had he not lived in a barbarous age, when the people knew not how to
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span>
discriminate
  his errors and defects. He was supposed to be the best artist of his day, and
  consequently gained a reputation as such, though his works are far beneath mediocrity.</p>
<p>Francis I. was a great encourager of the fine arts, and the artists themselves
  were liberally paid for their productions, until that king was unfortunately
  taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia, in the year 1525. After the death of
  Francis, the kingdom was distracted with civil wars, so that painting was entirely
  neglected by his immediate successors. In the year 1610, however, Louis XIII.
  recovered the arts from their languid state. In his reign, Jaques Blanchard
  was the most flourishing painter; although Francis Perier, Simon Vo&uuml;et,
  C.A. Du Fresnoy, and Peter Mignard, were equally gifted.</p>
<p>Of Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy, author of a Latin poem, entitled <i>De Arte
  Graphica</i>, I shall attempt a little account. This painter was born at Paris
  in the year 1611. His father, intending him for the profession of physic, sent
  him to the university of Paris, where he made great progress in his studies,
  and obtained several prizes in poetry. He had a great inclination for painting
  as well as for poetry, and, though much against his father's desire, resolved
  to leave off the study of physic, and commence that of drawing. The force of
  his inclination subduing every measure adopted to suppress it, he took every
  opportunity of cultivating his favourite study. Leaving college, he placed himself
  under Francis Perier, from whom he learned the art of designing. He afterwards
  thought fit to travel into Italy, where he arrived in 1633. Being abandoned
  by his parents, who were highly incensed at his having rejected the study of
  physic, he was reduced to the utmost distress on his arrival at Rome, and was
  compelled to paint trifling pieces for his daily subsistence. After two years
  of extreme toil and difficulty, he was relieved by the arrival of Mignard, the
  artist, who had formerly been the companion of his studies. Mignard evinced
  the warmest regard for his friend, and they were afterwards known in Rome by
  the name of the <i>inseparables</i>, for they lived in the same house, worked
  together, and united the produce of their labours. They were employed to copy
  all the best pictures in the Farnese Palace, and every evening attended an academy
  of drawing. Mignard was superior in practice, while Fresnoy was perfect master
  of the rules, history, and theory of his profession. They communicated their
  sentiments to each other, Fresnoy furnishing his friend with noble ideas, and
  the latter instructing the former to paint with more ease and dispatch. Fresnoy
  painted several fine pictures in Rome, and, in 1653, he left that city, in company
  with his friend, travelled to Venice, and then to Lombardy. Here the two friends
  parted,<a name="footnotetag3" id="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
  Mignard returning to Rome, and Fresnoy to his native city. After his arrival
  in Paris, he painted some beautiful historical pictures, which established his
  reputation. He perfectly understood architecture, and drew designs for many
  elegant mansions in Paris. During his travels in Italy, he planned and composed
  his <i>De Arte Graphica</i>, an excellent poem, full of valuable information,
  and containing unerring rules for the painter. This poem was twenty years in
  hand, and was not published until three years<a name="footnotetag4" id="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
  after the author's death, which took place in 1665. It has been observed, that
  Fresnoy possessed the genius requisite for forming a great master; and had he
  applied himself more strictly to painting, and educated pupils, he would doubtless
  have proved one of the greatest painters France ever produced. But, possessing
  high literary talents, he chose to lay down <i>precepts</i> for his countrymen,
  rather than to present them with <i>examples</i> of his art. He adhered too
  closely to the theory of painting, neglecting the more essential part&mdash;practice.</p>
<p>In the reign of Louis XIV., Nicholas Poussin distinguished himself as a painter,
  by displaying exquisite knowledge and great skill in composition. He generally
  painted ancient ruins, landscapes, and historical figures. He was likewise well
  acquainted with the manners and customs of the ancients; and, though he educated
  no pupils, and never had any imitators, his pictures are universally admired
  in every European country. Charles le Brun<a name="footnotetag5" id="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
  established the French school,&mdash;an undertaking which Vo&uuml;et had previously
  attempted. Le Brun drew well, had a ready conception, and a fertile imagination.
  His compositions are vast, but, in various instances, they may justly be termed
  <i>outre</i>. He possessed the animation, but not the inspiration of Raphael;
  and his design is not so pure as that of Domenichino, nor so lively as that
  of Annibale Caracci. Eustache le Seur, Le Brun's rival, possessed remarkable
  dignity, and wonderful correctness of style. Indeed, by some he has been called
  the Raphael of France. Had he lived longer, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>
(for he died at the age of thirty-eight,)
  the French school, under his direction, would most probably have adopted a manner
  which might have been imitated, and which might have established the arts on
  an eminence to vie with even imperial Rome. But, by the concurrence of extraordinary
  circumstances, Le Brun was the fashionable painter of the time, and it therefore
  became necessary to imitate <i>his</i> manner, rather than the more simple and
  more refined one of his rival. As Le Brun's imitators wanted his genius, his
  faults not only became current, but more glaring and deformed.</p>
<p>After Le Brun's death, which took place in 1690, the French artists degenerated
  greatly, their productions being decorated in a gaudy and theatrical way, without
  due regard to taste or decorum. Their school, some years ago, altered its principles,
  under the auspices of the spirited Count de Caylus, who possessed considerable
  merit as an artist. The count, by his high rank and fortune, had the means of
  encouraging the imitators of the ancients, and of procuring the best models
  in Italy for study. He, in conjunction with Monsieur Vien, first formed the
  design of restoring a pure taste in France; and if his countrymen had followed
  the path thus marked out for them, they would now have been equal to the greatest
  of the Greek painters. But it appears that they are incapable of rising to any
  very extraordinary height in the arts, for, with the exception of Le Seur, and
  one or two others, they have ever wanted that elevation of mind which so eminently
  distinguished the Romans. Though De Caylus greatly purified painting in his
  time, yet his precepts and examples had little or no weight after his death,
  for the art again retrograded into its original state&mdash;a state from which
  the French professors, as before observed, seem incapable of rising.</p>
<p>In our own days some few French artists have distinguished themselves, particularly
  Lefevre, who was the chief painter to Napoleon. A full-length portrait of the
  emperor in his coronation robes, for which Lefevre received the sum of five
  thousand Napoleons, and which I have lately had the pleasure of seeing, is very
  correct in drawing, and extremely rich and harmonious in colour; but it wants
  freedom and boldness of execution.</p>
<p>To conclude&mdash;the French are acknowledged to do pretty well within the
  precincts of their own country, though few of their pictures will stand in competition
  with those of the Italians, or with those produced in our own school.</p>

<h2>MANNERS &amp; CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.</h2>

<h3>SINGULAR JEWISH CUSTOM.</h3>

<p>Burckhardt, in his &quot;Travels through Syria,&quot; &amp;c. informs us, that
  at Tiberias, one of the four holy cities of the Talmud, the Jews observe a singular
  custom in praying. While the rabbin recites the Psalms of David, or the prayers
  extracted from them, the congregation frequently imitate, by their voice or
  gestures, the meaning of some remarkable passages; for example, when the rabbin
  pronounces the words, &quot;Praise the Lord with the sound of the trumpet,&quot;
  they imitate the sound of the trumpet through their closed fists. When &quot;a
  horrible tempest&quot; occurs, they puff and blow to represent a storm; or should
  he mention &quot;the cries of the righteous in distress,&quot; they all set
  up a loud screaming; and it not unfrequently happens, that while some are still
  blowing the storm, others have already begun the cries of the righteous, thus
  forming a concert which it is difficult for any but a zealous Hebrew to hear
  with gravity.</p>

<h3>CHARACTER OF THE KARPIANS, (ARABS.)</h3>

<p>They are such consummate thieves and rogues, that, according to an ancient
  tradition still current among them, they once tricked the devil himself. The
  story is as follows:&mdash;The devil had acquired a right to their fields, on
  which they agreed with him, that when their crops were ripe, they should retain
  the upper part and the devil should have the lower. They sowed all their lands
  with wheat, and the devil of course had nothing but the straw for his share.
  Next year the old gentleman, fully determined not to be again so bamboozled,
  stipulated that the upper part should belong to him and the lower to the Karpians;
  but then they sowed all their grounds with beet, turnips, and other esculent
  roots, and so the devil got nothing but the green tops for his portion.</p>

<h3>THE MODERN WELSH.</h3>

<p>The people of the principality are clean and industrious; there is, however,
  in the nature of a Welshman such a hurriness of manner and want of method, that
  he does nothing well; for his mind is over anxious, diverted from one labour
  to another, and hence every thing is incomplete, and leaves the appearance of
  confusion and negligence. The common exercises of the Welsh are running, leaping,
  swimming, wrestling, throwing the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span>
bar, dancing, hunting, fishing, and playing
  at fives against the church or tower; and they constitute the joy of youth,
  and the admiration of old age. The convivial amusements are singing and versification.
  In these favourite exercises the performers are of humble merit; the singing
  is mere roar and squeak; and the poetical effusions are nonsense, vested in
  the rags of language; and always slanderous, because the mind of the bard is
  not fertile in the production of topics. The Welsh character is the echo of
  natural feeling, and acts from instantaneous motives. The fine arts are strangers
  to the principality; and the Welshman seldom professes the buskin, or the use
  of the mallet, the graver, or the chisel; but although deficient in taste, he
  excels in duties and in intellect.</p>

<h3>ITALIAN WOMEN.</h3>

<p>Italy and England are undoubtedly possessed of a greater share of female beauty
  than any other country in Europe. But the English and Italian beauties, although
  both interesting, are very different from one another. The former are unrivalled
  for the delicacy and bloom of their complexions, the smoothness and mild expression
  of their features, their modest carriage, and the cleanliness of their persons
  and dress; these are qualities which strike every foreigner at his landing.
  On my first arrival in England, I was asked by a friend how I liked the English
  women; to which I replied that I thought them all handsome. This is the first
  impression they produce. There is an air of calmness and pensiveness about them,
  which surprises and interests particularly a native of the south. They seem
  to look, if I may apply to them the fine lines of one of their living poets&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><p>&quot;With eyes so pure, that from the ray</p>
<p>Dark vice would turn abash'd away;</p>
</div>
  <hr class="poem"  />
  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yet fill'd with all youth's sweet desires,</p>
<p>Mingling the meek and vestal fires</p>
<p>Of other worlds, with all the bliss</p>
<p>The fond weak tenderness of this.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Italian beauties are of a different kind. Their features are more regular,
  more animated; their complexions bear the marks of a warmer sun, and their eyes
  seem to participate of its fires; their carriage is graceful and noble; they
  have generally good figures; they are not indeed angelic forms, but they are
  earthly Venuses. It has been supposed by some, that the habitual view of those
  models of ideal beauty, the Greek statues, with which Italy abounds, may be
  an indirect cause conducing to the general beauty of the sex; be that as it
  may, I think the fine features and beautiful forms of the Italian fair have
  a great influence upon the minds of young artists, and this is perhaps one of
  the principal reasons why Italy has so long excelled in figure painters. A handsome
  female countenance, animated by the expression of the soul, is among the finest
  works of nature; the sight of it elevates the mind, and kindles the sparks of
  genius. Raphael took the models of his charming Madonnas from nature. Titian,
  Guido, Caracci, and others, derived their ideas of female beauty from the exquisite
  countenances so frequent in their native country.</p>

<h3>A LINNET AT SEA.</h3>

<p>It has been often observed, that birds, in the course of their flight from
  one country to another, will frequently resort to the rigging of a ship, as
  a resting-place in their transit across the wide ocean. Mr. Gray, in his &quot;Letters
  on Canada,&quot; gives the following instance:&mdash;Among the extraordinary
  things, he observes, one meets with at sea, it is not one of the least surprising
  to observe small <i>land birds</i> several hundred miles from land. I was sitting
  on deck, when, to my great surprise, my attention was arrested by the warbling
  of a bird. I looked up, and saw a <i>linnet</i> perched on the rigging, and
  whistling with as much ardour as if on a bush in a green meadow. It is not a
  little astonishing how these little birds should be able to continue on the
  wing so long as is necessary to fly several hundreds of miles, particularly
  when the usual shortness of their flight is considered. They continue sometimes
  with a vessel several days, and are frequently caught by the sailors; but it
  is remarked that they seldom live, though every care is taken to give them proper
  food. When the vessel rolls much, they find it difficult to retain their footing
  on the rigging, and you see them forced, as it were, to resume their flight
  in search of a better resting-place.</p>

<h3>WEATHERCOCKS.</h3>

<p>Weathercocks do not always show the real direction of a very gentle wind. The
  strange figures of them, usually the productions of capricious fancy, is one
  cause of their imperfection as vanes to indicate the wind. Griffins, half-moons,
  foxes, or figures of St. Margaret and the dragon, are not good shapes for weathercocks,
  which ought to be plain fans, the large surface of one side being counterbalanced
  against the weight of the other.</p>

<h3>THE VALUE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</h3>

<p>A general, though superficial acquaintance with such subjects as well-educated
  men and women talk about in mixed society is absolutely necessary. A practised
  eye will easily distinguish the silence of modest attention from the mute weariness
  of ignorance. The most inveterate talker, if he be not quite a fool, desires
  to be listened to as well as heard; and a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;
  may be placed and accented so as to show intelligence, or betray stupidity.
  Grace in action and deportment is so essential, that it may almost be said to
  make all that is beautiful in beauty. We do not mean that a lady should, in
  dancing, walking, or sitting, display attitudes worthy of a painter's model.
  In walking we, however, recommend something between the listless saunter of
  a she-dandy, and the bustling gait of a notable body, who perhaps saves three
  minutes out of four-and-twenty hours, by doing every thing throughout the day
  with a jerk and a toss.&mdash;Dancing, unless it be done quietly and gracefully,
  without the fatal results of a shining face, and red neck and arms, it is far
  better to forbear altogether, it being a very superfluous quality in a gentlewoman;
  whereas <i>to please</i> by all honest means is her proper calling and occupation.
  A high degree of <i>positive</i> grace is very rare, especially in northern
  climates, where the form is degraded and spoiled by ligatures and by cold; but
  every woman may attain to <i>negative</i> grace, by avoiding awkward and unmeaning
  habits. The incessant twirling of a reticule, the assiduous pulling of the fingers
  of a glove, opening and shutting a book, swinging a bell-rope, &amp;c. betray
  either impatience and weariness of the conversation, disrespect of the speakers,
  or a want of ease and self-possession by no means inseparably connected with
  modesty and humility; those persons who are most awkward and shy among their
  superiors in rank or information being generally most over-bearing and peremptory
  with their equals or inferiors. We are almost ashamed, in the nineteenth century,
  to say any thing concerning personal neatness; but cannot forbear hinting, that
  clean gloves and neat shoes aid the captivating powers of a lady much more certainly
  than pearl ear-rings or gold chains&mdash;that clean muslin is more bewitching
  than dirty <i>blond lace</i>&mdash;and that a pocket-handkerchief should be
  like a basilisk, a thing heard of, but never seen; we mean in the capacity in
  which our cold-catching, rheum-exciting climate calls it into action.</p>

<h3>KARL THEODORE KORNER.</h3>

<p>Korner is one of the poets of whom modern Germany is justly proud. His was
  not the mere theoretic heroism which contents itself with celebrating the deeds
  of others. His own conduct embodied the most noble conceptions of his imagination,
  and his life and death exhibited a splendid example of the patriotism which
  breathed throughout his verse. He was born at Dresden in 1791. His education
  was of the most careful kind. He was not only instructed in various branches
  of learning, but the elegant accomplishments of the fine arts were added, and
  the exercises of the body were not less attended to than those of the mind.
  Called upon to choose some occupation, he determined to apply himself to mining,
  and took up his residence at Vienna, where he enjoyed the advantage of a familiar
  intercourse with William Von Humboldt, the Prussian ambassador, Frederic Schlegel,
  and other eminent literary and scientific men. Here, within the short space
  of fifteen months, he produced a rapid succession of dramas, operas, and farces,
  as well as several small poems. The success of his works obtained him the appointment
  of poet to the court. He was now in the enjoyment of all that could render life
  happy&mdash;competence, distinction, esteem, friendship and love; but he resolved
  to sacrifice them all &quot;for that greatest mortal blessing, his country's
  freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could I,&quot; says he, in a letter to his father, &quot;could I, think
  you, stand aloof, contented to celebrate with weak inspiration the success of
  my conquering bre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg
  200]</span>thren? I am aware that you will suffer much anxiety,&mdash;My mother
  too will weep&mdash;may God be her comfort!&mdash;I cannot spare you this trial.
  That I simply offer my life is of little import; but that I offer it, crowned
  as it is with all the flowery wreaths of love, of friendship, and of joy,&mdash;that
  I cast away the sweet sensations which lived in the conviction that I have caused
  you no inquietude, no anguish,&mdash;this indeed is a sacrifice which can only
  be opposed to such a prize!&quot;</p>
<p>He left Vienna in March 1813, and joined the free corps which Major Von Lutzow
  was then forming. This was a voluntary association, and the corps was remarkable
  throughout the war for its valour and enterprise. In the midst of the most active
  campaigns, Korner continued to pour forth his verses. Other poets have written
  of battles in the retirement of the closet, but he sang his song of war on the
  tented field, and amid the din of conflict. Nor was this all: he collected too
  the strains of other poets, and adapted them to appropriate airs, to animate
  the ardour of his companions in arms. We cannot follow him through his career,
  brief as it was; but the subjoined incident is too striking to be omitted, and
  is especially adapted to our purpose, as it affords an opportunity of giving
  a passage of his unpremeditated verse in a moment of pain and danger.</p>
<p>On the 28th of May, Major Von Lutzow had determined on setting out on an expedition
  towards Thuringia, with four squadrons of his cavalry, and fifty cossacks. Korner
  earnestly entreated permission to accompany him, and his desire was fulfilled
  by his being appointed adjutant by Major Von Lutzow, who highly esteemed him,
  and wished to have him near his person.</p>
<p>The expedition passed in ten days through Halberstadt, Eisleben, Buttstadt,
  and Schlaitz, to Plauen, though not without encountering great danger from the
  enemy, who were dispersed throughout these districts, but, also, not without
  effecting some important results. Intelligence and information were procured,
  ammunition was captured and seized, and couriers on missions of importance were
  taken prisoners. The gallant troop acquired considerable renown, and harassed
  the enemy much, especially by cutting off his communications. A plan was in
  consequence laid by the French emperor for the extirpation of the corps, that,
  as a deterring example, no man should be left alive. The armistice, concluded
  at this moment, afforded an opportunity for putting it in practice. (The Duke
  of Padua, it is observable, particularly profited by this armistice; for being
  shut up in Leipzig by Generals Woronzow and Czernichef, with the co-operation
  of two battalions of the Lutzow infantry, he was only saved by this cessation
  of hostilities.)</p>
<p>Major Von Lutzow had received official information of the armistice at Plauen.
  Without expecting to meet with any opposition, he chose the shortest route to
  rejoin the infantry of his corps, having received the most confidential assurances
  of safety from the enemy's commanding officers, and proceeded along the high
  road, without interruption, to Kitzen, a village in the neighbourhood of Leipzig;
  but here he found himself surrounded and menaced by a very superior force. Theodore
  Korner was despatched to demand an explanation; but, instead of replying, the
  commander of the enemy struck at him with his sword; and it being now twilight,
  a general attack was made on the three squadrons of the Lutzow cavalry before
  they had drawn a sabre. Several were wounded and taken, and others dispersed
  in the surrounding country; but Major Von Lutzow himself was saved by the assistance
  of a squadron of Uhlans, who being in advance with the Cossacks, formed the
  van-guard, and consequently were not assailed at the same moment. He reached,
  with a considerable body of his troops, the right bank of the Elbe, where the
  infantry of his corps, and a squadron of its cavalry, were already collected.</p>
<p>Korner received the first blow, which he was not prepared to parry, as he approached
  close to the enemy's commanding officer to deliver his message without drawing
  his sabre, and was thus severely wounded in the head: the second blow only inflicted
  a slight injury. He fell back, but speedily recovered himself, and his spirited
  steed bore him in safety to a neighbouring wood. He was here occupied, at the
  first moment, with the assistance of a comrade, in binding up his wounds, when
  he perceived a troop of the enemy, who were in pursuit, riding towards him.
  His presence of mind did not forsake him, but turning towards the wood, he called
  with a loud voice, &quot;Fourth squadron,&mdash;Advance!&quot;&mdash;His stratagem
  succeeded&mdash;the enemy were appalled, drew back, and thus afforded him time
  to conceal himself deeper in the wood. It had now become dark, and he found
  a place in the thicket where he could remain undiscovered.</p>
<p>The pain of the deeper wound became very severe, his strength was exhausted,
  and his last hope was gone. It was in this extremity that he composed the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span>beautiful
  sonnet, of which the following is a translation:&mdash;</p>
<h4>FAREWELL TO LIFE.</h4>
<p>[Written in the night of the 17th and 18th of June, as I lay, severely wounded
  and helpless in a wood, expecting to die.]</p>
  <div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;My deep wound burns;&mdash;my pale lips quake in death,&mdash;</p>
<p>I feel my fainting heart resign its strife,</p>
<p>And reaching now the limit of my life,</p>
<p>Lord, to thy will I yield my parting breath!</p>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yet many a dream hath charm'd my youthful eye;</p>
<p>And must life's fairy visions all depart;</p>
<p>Oh surely no! for all that fired my heart</p>
<p>To rapture here, shall live with me on high.</p>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<p>And that fair form that won my earliest vow,</p>
<p>That my young spirit prized all else above,</p>
<p>And now adored as freedom, now as love,</p>
<p>Stands in seraphic guise, before me now.</p>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<p>And as my fading senses fade away,</p>
<p>It beckons me, on high, to realms of endless day!&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>During the night he heard the enemy searching the wood near him, but afterwards
  fell asleep, and was saved in the morning by two peasants. He was conveyed secretly
  into Leipsic, which was then under the French yoke, and where the concealment
  of any of the Lutzow free corps was prohibited, under severe punishment. He
  subsequently travelled in safety to Berlin, and having recovered from his wound,
  rejoined the corps of Lutzow on the right bank of the Elbe. Hostilities recommenced
  on the 17th of August; and on the 28th an engagement took place near Rosenberg,
  in which Korner fell. He was in pursuit of a body of the enemy, when the riflemen,
  who had found a rallying-place in some under-wood, sent forth a shower of balls
  upon their pursuers. By one of these Korner was wounded in the abdomen, the
  liver and spine were injured, and he was immediately deprived of speech and
  consciousness. He was carried to a neighbouring wood, but all medical aid was
  vain. He was buried under an oak in the village of Wobbelin, about a mile from
  Ludwigslust. A tomb has since been placed over his remains, and enclosed by
  a wall. He died at the early age of twenty-two.</p>

<h3>THE RESCUE.</h3>
<h4><i>By Miss Roberts.</i></h4>
<p class="quote">
&quot;King Stephen was a worthy peer.&quot;
</p>
<p>The hall was lofty, sculptured round with armorial devices, and hung with gaily-embroidered
  banners, which waved in the wind streaming from the crannies in windows which
  had suffered some dilapidation from the hand of time. Minstrel harps rang throughout
  the wide apartment, and at a board well covered with smoking viands&mdash;haunches
  of the red deer, bustards, cranes, quarters of mutton, pasties, the grinning
  heads of wild boars,&mdash;and flanked with flagons of wine, and tankards of
  foaming ale, sat King Stephen, surrounded by the flower of the Norman nobles,
  whose voices had placed him on the English throne. In the midst of the feast,
  the jovial glee of the wassailers was interrupted by the entrance of a page,
  who, forcing his way through the yeomen and lacqueys crowding at the door, flew
  with breathless haste to the feet of the king, and falling down on his knees,
  in faltering accents delivered the message with which he had been intrusted.
  &quot;Up, gallants,&quot; exclaimed the martial monarch, &quot;don your harness,
  and ride as lightly as you may to the relief of the Countess of Clare, she lies
  in peril of her life and honour, beleaguered by a rabble of unnurtured Welsh
  savages, who, lacking respect for beauty, have directed their arms against a
  woman. Swollen with vain pride at their late victory, (the fiend hang the coward
  loons who fled before them,) they have sworn to make this noble lady serve them
  barefoot in their camp. By St. Dennis and my good sword, were I not hampered
  by this pestilent invasion of the Scots, I would desire no better pastime than
  to drive the ill-conditioned serfs howling from the walls. Say, who amongst
  you will undertake the enterprise?&mdash;What, all silent? are ye knights? are
  ye men? do I reign over christian warriors, valiant captains who have been sworn
  to protect beauty in distress; or are ye like the graceless dogs of Mahomed,
  insensible to female honour?&quot; &quot;My ranks are wonderous scant,&quot;
  returned Milo Fitzwalter, &quot;I may not reckon twenty men at arms in the whole
  train, and varlets have I none; but it boots not to number spears when danger
  presses; so to horse and away. Beshrew me, were it the termagant Queen Maude
  herself, I'd do my <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg
  202]</span>best to rescue her in this extremity.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Thou art
  a true knight, Fitzwalter,&quot; replied the king, &quot;and wilt prosper: the
  Saint's benizon be with thee, for thou must speed on this errand with such tall
  men as thou canst muster of thine own proper followers: the Scots, whom the
  devil confound, leave me too much work, to spare a single lance from mine own
  array. We will drink to thy success, and to the health of the fair countess,
  in a flask of the right Bourdeaux: and tell the lady that thy monarch grudges
  thee this glorious deed; for by my Halidom, an thou winnest her unscathed from
  the hands of these Welsh churls, thou wilt merit a niche beside the most renowned
  of Charlemagne's paladins.&quot; Fitzwalter made no answer, but he armed in
  haste, and, leaping into his saddle, gave the spur to his gallant steed, and
  followed by his esquires and men at arms, rested not either night or day, until
  he reached the marches of Wales. The lions of England still proudly flying over
  the castle walls, assured him that the countess had been enabled to hold out
  against the savage horde, who surrounded it on all sides. The besiegers set
  up a furious yell as the knight and his party approached their encampment. Half
  naked, their eyes glaring wildly from beneath a mass of yellow hair, and scantily
  armed with the rudest species of offensive and defensive weapons, their numbers
  alone made them terrible; and had the castle been manned and victualled, it
  might have long defied their utmost strength. Drawing their falchions, the knight
  and his party keeping closely together, and thus forming an impenetrable wedge,
  cut their desperate path through the fierce swarm of opposing foes, who, like
  incarnate demons, rushed to the onslaught, and fell in heaps before the biting
  steel of these experienced soldiers. Pressing forward with unyielding bravery,
  Fitzwalter won the castle walls; whence, with the assistance of such frail aid
  as the living spectres on the battlements could give, he beat back the Welsh
  host, and in another quarter of an hour, having dispersed the enemy with frightful
  loss, gained free entrance to the castle. Feeble was the shout of triumph which
  welcomed Fitzwalter and his brave companions; the corpses of the unburied dead
  lay strewed upon the pavement; the heroic countess, and her attendant damsels,
  clad in the armour of the slain, weakened by famine, and hopeless of succour,
  yet still striving to deceive the besiegers by the display of living warriors,
  by this stratagem retarded the assault which they could not repel. Fitzwalter
  took advantage of the darkness of the night, and the panic of the Welshmen,
  to withdraw from a fortress which was destitute of all the implements of war;
  and with the rescued ladies mounted behind them, the brave band returned to
  the court of King Stephen; and the charms of the fair one, and the valour of
  her chivalric defender, formed the theme of the minstrel in every knightly hall
  and lady's bower throughout Christendom.</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH NOVEL READER.</h3>

<p>How shall I describe the emotions with which I read the first novel I ever
  perused! A school-fellow had secretly brought with him from home after the holidays,
  the novel of Peregrine Pickle, which he carefully concealed in his trunk. He
  at first lent it to some of the elder boys, who read it, and enlarging on some
  of the most despicable incidents to be found, disgusted my meek spirit of it,
  by their report. It seemed to violate all my cherished ideas of beauty and soft
  luxury. I was then about fourteen years of age, and my companions persuaded
  me to a perusal. I took it up listlessly, expecting but little pleasure, but
  what language can paint the manner in which I was entranced by it? I read it
  over and over with increased delight, my entire soul and frame of mind and passions
  seemed to be suddenly changed and remodelled. I forgot Ariadne and Telemachus,
  and Tom Pipes and Hatchway became my idols, the undivided objects of my admiration.</p>
<p>I had hitherto been a remarkably quiet and inoffensive boy; Telemachus I considered
  never took delight in robbing orchards. I had the confidence of my teachers
  from my uniform rejection of any participation in the rude affrays, the catastrophe
  of which dramas was in general an almost universal flogging match. My admiration
  naturally led to its probable result, a desire to imitate&mdash;I firmly resolved
  to become a Peregrine. I soon promoted myself to be the leader of every mad
  prank that the wit of a spirit suddenly excited to activity could devise. In
  the first fortnight I got flogged for tying a huge mass of brown paper to the
  tail of the favourite cat of the master's lady, with which she rushed with an
  insane and terrifying distraction into the drawing-room. We owed a spite to
  a neighbouring milkman for tale-bearing, and we rendered his pump, the great
  source <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span>of
  profit, useless, by filling it with soot and mire. The old woman who served
  the school with tarts, and who, in her endeavours to please all palates, brought
  some varieties heated over a charcoal fire, had her apparatus blown to atoms
  by an ounce of gunpowder, insinuated with so much art, that although done before
  her face, she could attach no one with the offence. All became riot, waste,
  and destruction under the guidance of my beloved Peregrine.</p>
<p>But, ah! the poor Count&mdash;amiable, patient, and long-suffering Gaul! He
  was an unhappy refugee, who had sought a home, by becoming the reviled, insulted
  teacher of his native tongue to a mob of heartless ruffians. How well do I remember
  his neat but thread-bare coat and pigtail; his stooping gait, not the decrepitude
  of age, but as though it sprang from the abasement of his fortune; his endurance
  of injury to a certain point, when patience suddenly forsook him, and his, to
  us, irresistibly comic rage and exasperation! What would that generous seaman
  Pipes have thought a defenceless Frenchman fit for, but as the object of spirited
  and well-conducted pranks? Nothing cruel or revengeful, but only to show our
  own superior wit and address in concerted and premeditated annoyance.</p>
<p>I had gained with a most surprising rapidity upon the confidence of the most
  conspicuous rioters in the school. There was something so noble and daring in
  all my designs, that they seemed to yield willingly to so superior a spirit.
  The sudden alteration in my manners had been noticed with secret wonder by the
  masters, and they, thinking to check my fatal tendencies at the outset, had
  inflicted on me several severe and well-merited chastisements. I converted even
  these into means of extending my influence. I had borne them like a hero, a
  very Peregrine. No groan&mdash;no sigh&mdash;no bellowing promise of amendment,
  had lessened my dignity. Under the torture, I was sullen and silent. The stoutest
  heart in the school envied my manhood and composure.</p>
<p>The poor French teacher had been the hereditary object of annoyance for several
  generations of boys. The meekest and most chicken-hearted scrubs in the school
  tried their apprenticeship to mischief upon him, and were tutored to more noble
  game by beginning with the Count. They split and cut his pens into a thousand
  fantastic shapes during a momentary absence; they filled his snuff with the
  most odious pulverulents. They placed on his desk rude, but expressive designs
  of a guillotine, with a meagre fellow in ruffles and no shirt, running in the
  extremity of speed from the spot. These, and a thousand exhibitions of budding
  genius, and original sin, were our daily subjects of merriment and applause.
  I taught them nobler arts, or rather the spirit of Pickle which spake within
  me. It was nothing to annoy on such a petty and momentary scale; let the art
  and forethought of Hatchway be exhibited.</p>
<p>The amiable Frenchman was a zealous Catholic, and upon certain festivals always
  received from a Catholic gentleman of rank and fortune in the neighbourhood,
  an invitation to visit him. On these occasions his dress was the most ludicrous
  imaginable, being compounded of remnants of pristine finery, such as his wardrobe
  could afford, without attention to uniformity, or consistency of colour. Above
  all, he possessed a pair of light pea-green small clothes, on which he much
  prided himself, and I swore by old Trunnion to be their murderer. His custom
  on the aforesaid visits was to dress early, and then hastily to dismiss his
  lessons, and proceed immediately.</p>
<p>Having gained intelligence of an approaching field day, we prepared a strong
  solution of gum, with which we varnished the bottom of a leather chair upon
  which he sat in the school. The morning came, his green <i>media</i> and white
  silk stockings were hailed with the most extravagant but secret exultation.
  He seated himself, and let us run as we pleased through our tasks, with an unusual
  portion of smiles and pleasantries, and then looking at his watch, he attempted
  hastily to rise! in vain&mdash;there seemed an indissoluble bond of union between
  him and the chair; the most grotesque series of strugglings ensued, and by one
  desperate effort he was erect, a thin coating of the black leather which he
  had torn off, firmly adhering to his dress! Nothing abated my delight at my
  success, but the thought that my magnus Apollo, Pickle, was not there to enjoy
  it; to see the poor Count stand mute with a mixed passion of rage and distress
  for several seconds, and then to witness his fruitless attempts to view the
  full extent of the injury, which, notwithstanding the surprising flexibility
  of his vertebrae, he was unable to compass. Tom Pipes I felt certain would have
  died on the spot, he must have split.</p>

<h3>CONTRAST OF CLIMATE.</h3>

<p>Suppose yourself to have spent the first half of a foggy, sleety, chill, moist,
  melancholy, English winter at some misera<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg
  204]</span>ble country village in Kent. Suppose about the first of February,
  while the whole landscape around is still floating in mud, buried in snow, or
  fast bound by frost, and the atmosphere so thick with fog, that one can scarcely
  point at mid-day to the spot where the sun stands in the heavens,&mdash;that
  your catarrh grows so alarming, that in a fit of despondency you trundle yourself
  aboard a ship in the Downs getting under way for a warmer climate. Suppose,
  that after a smacking run of about eight days before a fresh gale, (during the
  whole of which you are of course too sick and qualmy to leave your cot,) you
  awake one morning, and find yourself snugly at anchor in the bay of Funchal;
  and the romantic, sun-bright mountains of Madeira, gorgeously crested with a
  mass of brilliant clouds, looking in at your cabin-window. It seems downright
  enchantment! You leap up as if there was a new soul in your body. You hurry
  ashore in the first boat. Your cough, lassitude, and qualmishness have altogether
  left you. Your step is elastic, and your spirits as buoyant as a lark in spring.
  You luxuriate amidst beautiful gardens glowing with roses, jessamines, honey-suckles,
  and a thousand other odoriferous shrubs and flowers in full bloom. You wander
  through a boundless maze of rising vineries curling their budding tendrils around
  the trellis-work, and terrace above terrace up the declivities of the mountains.
  You recline among orange-groves bending under the load of ripe golden fruit;
  and as you stretch yourself at ease by some clear, gurgling rill, in the midst
  of all this loveliness, you ask yourself, is this a dream&mdash;or are these
  indeed the gardens of the Hesperides? Reader, if you have the blue devils at
  Christmas, you may realize all this, and reach Madeira, as I have done, in eight
  days from the Downs.</p>

<h3>ANECDOTES OF THE FACULTY.</h3>

<h4><i>Quacks.</i></h4>

<p>We are not without plenty of ignorant and impudent pretenders at the present
  day; but the celebrated Mrs. Mapp, the bone-setter of Epsom, surpasses them
  all. She was the daughter of a man named Wallis, a bone-setter at Hindon, in
  Wiltshire, and sister to the celebrated &quot;Polly Peachem,&quot; who married
  the Duke of Bolton. Upon some <i>family quarrel</i>, Sally Wallis left her professional
  parent, and wandered up and down the country in a miserable manner, calling
  herself &quot;Crazy Sally,&quot; and pursuing, in her perambulations, a course
  that fairly justified the title. Arriving at last at Epsom, she succeeded in
  humbugging the worthy bumpkins of that place, so decidedly, that a subscription
  was set on foot to keep her among them; but her fame extending to the metropolis,
  the dupes of London, a numerous class then as well as now, thought it no trouble
  to go ten miles to see the conjuror, till at length, she was pleased to bless
  the afflicted of London with her presence, and once a week drove to the Grecian
  Coffee-house, in a coach and six with out-riders! and all the appearance of
  nobility. It was in one of these journeys, passing through Kent-street, in the
  Borough, that being taken for a certain woman of quality from the Electorate
  in Germany, a great mob followed, and bestowed on her many bitter reproaches,
  till madame, perceiving some mistake, looked out of the window, and accosted
  them in this gentle manner, &quot;D&mdash;&mdash;n your bloods, don't you know me? I am
  Mrs. Mapp, the <i>bone-setter!</i>&quot; Upon which, they instantly changed
  their revilings into loud huzzas.</p>
<p class="source"><i>Wadd's Mems., Maxims, and Memoirs.</i></p>

<h4><i>Dr. Radcliffe.</i></h4>

<p>Among the many singularities related of Radcliffe, it has been noticed, that
  when he was in a convivial party, he was unwilling to leave it, even though
  sent for by persons of the highest distinction. Whilst he was thus deeply engaged
  at a tavern, he was called on by a grenadier, who desired his immediate attendance
  on his <i>colonel</i>; but no entreaties could prevail on the disciple of Esculapius
  to postpone his sacrifice to Bacchus. &quot;Sir,&quot; quoth the soldier, &quot;<i>my
  orders are to bring you.</i>&quot; And being a very powerful man, he took him
  up in his arms, and carried him off per force. After traversing some dirty lanes,
  the doctor and his escort arrived at a narrow alley&mdash;&quot;What the D&mdash;&mdash;l
  is all this,&quot; said Radcliffe, &quot;your colonel don't live here?&quot;&mdash;&quot;No,&quot;
  said his military friend,&mdash;&quot;no, my <i>colonel</i> does not live here&mdash;but
  my <i>comrade</i> does, and he's worth <i>two</i> of the <i>colonel</i>,&mdash;so,
  by G&mdash;d, doctor, if you don't do your <i>best</i> for <i>him</i>, it will
  be the <i>worst</i> for <i>you!</i>&quot;</p>

<h4><i>Duels.</i></h4>

<p>Many medical duels have been prevented by the difficulty of arranging the &quot;me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg
  205]</span>thodus pugnandi.&quot; In the instance of Dr. Brocklesby, the number
  of paces could not be agreed upon; and in the affair between Akenside and Ballow,
  one had determined never to fight in the morning, and the other that he would
  never fight in the afternoon. John Wilkes, who did not stand upon ceremony in
  these little affairs, when asked by Lord Talbot, &quot;How many times they were
  to fire?&quot; replied, &quot;just as often as your Lordship pleases; I have
  brought <i>a bag of bullets and a flask of gunpowder</i>.&quot;</p>

<h4><i>William Hunter.</i></h4>

<p>Dr. William Hunter used to relate the following anecdote:&mdash;During the
  American war, he was consulted by the daughter of a peer, who confessed herself
  pregnant, and requested his assistance; he advised her to retire for a time
  to the house of some confidential friend; she said that was impossible, as her
  father would not suffer her to be absent from him a single day. Some of the
  servants were, therefore, let into the secret, and the doctor made his arrangement
  with the treasurer of the Foundling Hospital for the reception of the child,
  for which he was to pay 190<i>l</i>.&mdash;The lady was desired to weigh well
  if she could bear pain without alarming the family by her cries; she said &quot;Yes,&quot;&mdash;and
  she kept her word. At the usual period she was delivered, not of one child only,
  but of twins. The doctor, bearing the two children, was conducted by a French
  servant through the kitchen, and left to ascend the area steps into the street.
  Luckily the lady's maid recollected that the door of the area might perhaps
  be locked; and she followed the doctor just in time to prevent his being detained
  at the gate. He deposited the children at the Foundling Hospital, and paid for
  each 100<i>l</i>. The father of the children was a colonel of the army, who
  went with his regiment to America, and died there. The mother afterwards married
  a person of her own rank.</p>

<h4><i>John Hunter.</i></h4>

<p>Hunter was a philosopher in more senses than one; he had philosophy enough
  to bear prosperity, as well as adversity, and with a rough exterior was a very
  kind man. The poor could command his services more than the rich. He would see
  an industrious tradesman before a duke, when his house was full of grandees,
  &quot;you have no time to spare,&quot; he would say, &quot;you live by it; most
  of these can wait, they have nothing to do when they go home.&quot; No man cared
  less for the profits of the profession, or more for the honour of it. He cared
  not for money himself, and wished the Doctor [his brother William] to estimate
  it by the same scale, when he sent a poor man with this laconic note:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">
&quot;Dear Brother,&mdash;The bearer wants
your advice. I do not know the nature of case. He has no money, and you
have plenty, so are well met.&quot;</p>
<p class="quote">&quot;Yours, J. HUNTER.&quot; </p>
<p>He was applied to once to perform a serious operation on a tradesman's wife;
  the fee agreed upon was twenty guineas. He heard no more of the case for two
  months; at the end of which time he was called upon to perform it. In the course
  of his attendance, he found out that the cause of the delay had been the difficulty
  under which the patient's husband had laboured to raise the money; and that
  they were worthy people, who had been unfortunate, and were by no means able
  to support the expense of such an affliction. &quot;I sent back to the husband
  nineteen guineas, and kept the twentieth,&quot; said he, &quot;that they might
  not be hurt with an idea of too great obligation. It somewhat more than paid
  me for the expense I had been at in the business.&quot;</p>

<h3>BURMESE BOATS.</h3>

<p>The Burman war-boat is formed of the trunk of the magnificent teak tree, first
  roughly shaped, and then expanded by means of fire, until it attains sufficient
  width to admit two people, sitting abreast. On this a gunwale, rising a foot
  above the water, is fixed, and the stem and stern taper to a point, the latter
  being much higher than the other, and ornamented with fret-work and gilding.
  On the bow is placed a gun, sometimes of a nine-pounder calibre, but generally
  smaller, and the centre of the boat is occupied by the rowers, varying in number
  from twenty to a hundred, who in the large boats use the oar, and in the small
  ones the paddle. A war-boat in motion is a very pleasing object. The rapidity
  with which it moves, its lightness, and small surface above the water, the uniform
  pulling of the oar falling in cadence with the songs of the boatmen, who, taking
  the lead from one of their number, join in chorus, and keep time with the dip
  of their oars; the rich gilding which adorns the boat, and the neat, uniform
  dress of the crew, place it, to the eye of a stranger, in a curious and interesting
  point of view: and in regard to appearance, induces him, when contrasting it
  with an English boat, to give the former the preference. In point of swiftness,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span>our
  best men-of-war boats could not compete with them; and of this superiority they
  generally availed themselves when an action was impending.</p>
<p>The boats we had captured at Rangoon, and were cutting down for the transport
  of the army, were totally of a different nature. These, built on the same plan
  as ours are, but with flat bottoms, belonged to traders, and were solely adapted
  to the transport of merchandise. The stern, fancifully ornamented, rises two
  or three stages above the deck, and is the seat of the helmsman. The inside
  of the boat is filled with goods, and thatched over, leaving sufficient room
  underneath to accommodate two or three families&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;who
  promiscuously take up their abode there.</p>
<p>This description of boat is not propelled by oars, but by long poles, the ends
  of which being placed against the shoulders of the boatmen, they run the whole
  length of the boat, and push her forward with considerable velocity. The space
  on which they act is formed by strong outriggers on either side of the boat,
  which answer the twofold purpose of preventing her upsetting, which she otherwise
  would do from the excess of top-weight, and of increasing her width and accommodation.</p>
<p>The third class of boat is that used throughout the country, and which, to
  those who inhabit the banks of rivers, becomes a necessary appendage, and to
  many a home. It is a mere canoe, decked with split bamboo, and partly covered
  in with mats, so as to afford shelter from the sun by day, and the dews by night.
  One man steers, and two others either row or paddle; but, when the wind is favourable,
  they use a sail. This is generally made at the moment, with the scarfs they
  wear over their shoulders, tied together. Two bamboos constitute the mast and
  yard, the sail being fastened between them; yet, with this fragile rigging,
  and with the gunwale of the boat almost under water with every puff of wind,
  they stem the most rapid currents at all seasons of the year, and, such is their
  skill in steering, seldom meet with an accident. It was in these boats that
  the majority of the inhabitants of Rangoon, and the adjacent villages, fled
  upon our approach; and these formed their only habitation during the many months
  they kept aloof from us.</p>

<h3>THE VEIL OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.</h3>

<p>Maria Stuart has been canonized, and placed among the martyrs by the Jesuits.
  Of course there are relics of hers. Her prayer-book was long shown in France;
  and her apologist published in an English journal a sonnet which she was said
  to have composed, and to have written with her own hand in this book. A celebrated
  German actress, Mrs. Hendel-Schutz, who excited admiration by her attitudes,
  and also performed Schiller's &quot;Maria&quot; with great applause in several
  cities of Germany, affirmed that a cross which she wore on her neck was the
  very same that once belonged to the unfortunate queen. Relics of this description
  have never yet been subjected to the proof of their authenticity. But if there
  is anything which may be reasonably believed to have been once the property
  of the queen, <i>it is the veil with which she covered her head on the scaffold,
  after the executioner</i>, whether from awkwardness or confusion is uncertain,
  <i>had wounded the unfortunate victim in the shoulder by a false blow</i>. This
  veil still exists, and is in the possession of Sir J.C. Hippisley, who claims
  to be descended from the Stuart's by the mother's side. He had an engraving
  made from it by Matteo Diottavi, in Rome, 1818, and gave copies to his friends.</p>
<p>The veil is embroidered with gold spangles by (as is said) the queen's own
  hand, in regular rows crossing each other, so as to form small squares, and
  edged with a gold border, to which another border has been subsequently joined,
  in which the following words are embroidered in letters of gold:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote"> &quot;Velum Serenissim&aelig; Mari&aelig;, Scoti&aelig; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg
  207]</span>et Galli&aelig; Regin&aelig; Martyris, quo induebatur dum ab Heretica
  ad mortem iniustissimam condemnata fuit. Anno Sal. MDLXXXVI. a nobilissima matrona
  Anglicana diu conservatum et tandem, donationis ergo Deo, Societati Jesu consecratum.&quot;
</p>
<p>On the plate there is an inscription, with a double certificate of its authenticity,
  which states, that this veil, a family treasure of the expelled house of Stuart,
  was finally in possession of the last branch of that family, the cardinal of
  York, who preserved it for many years in his private chapel, among the most
  precious relics, and at his death bequeathed it to Sir J. Hippisley, together
  with a valuable Plutarch, and a Codex with painted (illuminated) letters, and
  a gold coin struck in Scotland in the reign of queen Mary; and it was specially
  consecrated by Pope Pius VII. in his palace on the Quirinal, April 29, 1818.
  Sir John Hippisley, during a former residence at Rome, had been very intimate
  with the cardinal of York, and was instrumental in obtaining for him, when he
  with the other cardinals emigrated to Venice in 1798, a pension of &pound;4,000.
  a-year from the Prince of Wales, now King George IV.; but for which, the fugitive
  cardinal, all whose revenues were seized by the French, would have been exposed
  to the greatest distress. The cardinal desired to requite this service by the
  bequest of what he considered so valuable. According to a note on the plate,
  the veil is eighty-nine English inches long, and forty-three broad, so that
  it seems to have been rather a kind of shawl or scarf than a veil. If we remember
  rightly, Melville in his Memoirs, which Schiller had read, speaks of a handkerchief
  belonging to the queen, which she gave away before her death, and Schiller founds
  upon this anecdote the well-known words of the farewell scene, addressed to
  Hannah Kennedy.</p>
<p class="quote">&quot;Accept this handkerchief! with my own hand<br />
For thee I've work'd it in my hours of sadness<br />
And interwoven with my scalding tears:<br />
With this thou'lt bind my eyes.&quot;</p>

<h2>THE LECTURER</h2>
<hr />

<h3>AN EXCERP FROM ABERNETHY'S LECTURES.</h3>

<p>When I was speaking of the cure of the digestive organs, I spoke of stomachic
  irritation, and said it was occasioned by some morbid peculiarity. It is difficult
  to find out the exigents; it must be done by experiment. We give a medicine,
  it answers. The digestive organs have such a sympathy with contiguous organs,
  that no wonder if such contiguous organs are affected. The liver, for instance,
  cannot perform its office aright if the bowels are uncomfortable. Violent drastics
  are wrong, they do not do good; you cannot go on giving physic every day, this
  will teaze the bowels and not tranquilize them, The cure is to repeat the excitement
  of progressive action. People in general will not find out that what may be
  an adequate excitement one day, may not be an adequate excitement on another
  day. As to these things, they are easily managed, and you should attend to them.
  Every person advanced in life knows this, and attends to it. Doctor Curry, whom
  I used to call the poetical doctor, says, very justly, &quot;It is in medicine
  as it is in morals, you must break bad habits, and establish good ones.&quot;</p>
<p>Where the liver is primarily affected, small doses of quicksilver act in a
  wonderful and a prodigious manner. How the stomach, when wrong, disturbs the
  head, is apparent to every one. How a faulty action of the liver disturbs the
  head is also well known; but the liver, in an especial manner, disturbs the
  head.</p>
<p>A Yorkshireman came three hundred miles, as he told me, on purpose to see me,
  and he said he was going back again by the mail the same night. I asked him
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span>what
  could induce him to come so far. His reply was, &quot;Why you once set up a
  friend of mine, and I thought you could set me up too.&quot;</p>
<p>I would have you keep your eyes open to this, that we are perpetually putting
  wrong our digestive organs by our absurdities in diet. These organs, if long
  wrong, will affect the spinal chord, producing lumbar numbness. Now, then, I
  have surveyed the influence of local maladies in disturbing the nervous energies,
  and now I say there is a reflected action in them, and they become a fruitful
  source of a numerous and dissimilar progeny of local diseases.</p>
<p>People are disposed to say I am apt to exaggerate too much; but I merely relate
  what I have seen in my time, and you will all have numerous instances by and
  by of making the same observations, and I think at last you will come to the
  same conclusions.</p>
<p>I now speak of local diseases; and, first, of phlegmonous inflammation. I do
  not much like the term phlegmonous inflammation, because phlegmon alone is inflammation.
  That the vessels, particularly the arteries, of inflamed parts are disposed
  to receive more blood, is manifest. Mr. Hunter froze the ears of rabbits, and
  the arteries inflamed and were filled with blood, throbbing, and pain. When
  there is great disturbance of the arterious system, with throbbing, there is
  always acute pain. In common whitlow of the finger, how the arteries of the
  arm, the brachial in particular, throb, is well known. In proportion as arteries
  are excited to vehement action, some difficulty occurs to the transmission of
  the blood into the veins. Dr. Phillips found that inflamed blood is slower in
  cooling than common blood.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
